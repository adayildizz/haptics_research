# Row-type discriminator. Every trial the participant was shown gets a row;
# ``outcome`` is what tells them apart, so downstream code never has to infer
# intent from a blank cell. These deliberately line up with the trace
# database's per-attempt ``outcome`` (see trace_store.AttemptOutcome), so the
# CSV and the replay recordings describe the same set of events:
#   answered  -- a response was given (the only rows the curve fit consumes)
#   timeout   -- the response window closed; the trial was re-queued
#   exhausted -- the last attempt allowed by max_trial_attempts also expired.
#                A refinement of "timeout", not a separate kind of event: the
#                trace stores these as timeout too, since "was this the last
#                attempt" is a scheduling fact, not a per-attempt one.
#   aborted   -- exit key or closed window ended the trial (and the session)
