# Tactile Bar Graph Perception Experiment

Psychophysics experiment measuring the JND (just noticeable difference) for tactile bar height on an electroadhesion haptic display, using the method of constant stimuli. The goal is to characterize tactile height discrimination without visual information, enabling data access for non-visual users.

## Hardware

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Tactile display | Electroadhesion, 4V peak, 125 Hz carrier frequency |
| Position sensor | Nexio NIB170BP infrared frame, ~100 Hz |
| Interface | IR frame presents as virtual mouse via OS driver |

## Experimental Design: Method of Constant Stimuli

One base (reference) height and one bar width are fixed per session (a "configuration"). Comparison heights are placed symmetrically around the base at fixed percentage offsets (`±delta_max_pct` by default), with a fixed number of trials per level -- no staircase, no reversals. Every parameter of this design is a field on `ExperimentConfig` (see `config.py`), loaded from a YAML/TOML file; nothing about the design is hard-coded.

- `levels = linspace(-delta_max_pct, +delta_max_pct, n_levels)`, dropping the 0% level unless `include_zero_level` is set.
- `comparison_height_mm = base_height_mm * (1 + level)`.
- `trials_per_level` reps per level, plus `catch_trial_pct` extra easy (±`delta_max_pct`) trials as a lapse/attention check.
- Reference/comparison side (left/right) is counterbalanced within each level, across the whole block rather than within each sub-block.
- Trial order is randomized **within blocks**, not by one shuffle of the whole set. Each block holds `sweeps_per_block` presentations of every level (default 1, so blocks of `n_levels`), and order is shuffled inside the block. The seeded RNG makes this reproducible; the seed actually used is always logged, even when `rng_seed` is left unset (a fresh one is drawn and recorded).

### Why blocked, not one global shuffle

Both schemes give each level its configured number of trials and both are unbiased *on average*. The difference is what happens within a single session, which is what a threshold is estimated from. Measured over 2000 seeds of the default design (6 levels x 10 trials + 6 catch):

| | one global shuffle | blocked (default) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A level's trials split between first and second half | 4.6 apart on average, worst 10-0 | exactly even, always |
| Sessions with a 4-6 split or worse | 84% | 0% |
| Longest run of the same level | up to 6 | 2 |
| Same level within a 10-trial window | up to 7 | 3 |
| Four or more catch trials in one third of the session | 28% | 0% |
| A third of the session with no catch trial at all | 23% | 5% |

A session runs ~20 minutes, over which fatigue, learning, and the skin's coupling to the surface all drift. A global shuffle leaves level confounded with time-on-task by exactly that much, and the drift lands on the threshold estimate. Blocking removes the confound by construction and caps same-level runs at two (one at each side of a block boundary).

Catch trials are placed one per block, at a random position inside it, for the same reason: sampling attention across the session works poorly if a quarter of sessions leave a third of the session unsampled.

`sweeps_per_block: 2` gives blocks of 12 instead of 6. Balance is still exact and runs cap at 4; the trade is that with blocks of exactly one sweep the last trial of a block is in principle determined by the preceding five. That is not a realistic concern for a blindfolded 2AFC height judgment, but the wider block is there if a design wants it. `trials_per_level` must be divisible by `sweeps_per_block`.

Both bars are rendered simultaneously on a split screen. Bar interior = signal ON, exterior = OFF.

### Pilot mode

`mode: staircase_pilot` runs the original 1-up/2-down adaptive staircase (`staircase.py`) at one base height, to locate the approximate JND before committing to a `delta_max_pct` range for constant stimuli. At the end it prints the pilot JND and warns if it exceeds `delta_max_pct / 1.5` (range likely too narrow).

## Rendering Method

Bar width is rendered using a **software-based timing method** rather than position-based polling. When the leading edge of a bar is detected, stimulus duration is computed as:

```
duration = bar_width / finger_speed
```

A high-resolution timer (`time.perf_counter()`) controls signal delivery independently of the IR frame rate. This bypasses the sampling bottleneck: at ~100 Hz with 10 cm/s finger speed, classical position-based rendering cannot reliably deliver bars narrower than ~2-3 mm. Per trial, each bar crossing ("pass") is logged separately with its commanded duration, actual on-duration, entry finger speed, and whether the leading edge was cleanly detected (used to separate perceptual failures from rendering failures during analysis).

## Procedure

Each session runs as a single participant-facing fullscreen flow. The
participant is blindfolded and wears headphones; the screen is for the
operator. **Space** or **Enter** (main keyboard) advances the flow and
**Escape** safely exits at any point (as does closing the window). Both are
operator keys, deliberately out of reach of the participant's answering hand.
The task is two-alternative forced choice (2AFC): two bars are rendered
side-by-side and the participant decides which is **taller**.

The participant explores with the **index finger of the dominant hand** and
answers with the **other hand** on the arrow keys, which the operator places on
the side of the non-exploring hand. Record which hand explores in
`dominant_hand` (`left` / `right`); it is written to every trial row and the
config snapshot so exploration strategies can be compared by hand.

From the moment the program starts until it exits, **continuous brown noise**
(`masking_noise`, level `masking_noise_volume`) plays in the headphones from a
reserved mixer channel, masking the rig; the cues and the practice voice play
over it (`experiment/masking_noise.py`).

1. **Start screen.** The session opens on a "Ready to begin" prompt showing the
   mode and the base height/width for this configuration. Press **Space** or
   **Enter** to begin.
2. **Practice block** (skipped if `n_practice_trials == 0`). `n_practice_trials`
   easy trials drawn from the `practice_easiest_levels` largest level magnitudes
   (with the default design: ±20% and ±30%), **feedback forced on**, under the
   same response limit as the main block (unanswered practice trials are re-shown
   at the end of the round, subject to the same `max_trial_attempts` cap).
   Because the participant is blindfolded, feedback is **spoken**
   (`practice_spoken_feedback`: “Correct” / “Incorrect”) as well as shown on
   screen for the operator. Optional spoken speed coaching says “Faster,”
   “Good speed,” or “Slower” after a stable speed reading; it is disabled
   throughout the main block. Voice output uses native Windows SAPI through
   PowerShell on Windows, `say` on macOS, and `espeak` or `spd-say` on Linux.

   **Pass mark.** A round passes when at least
   `ceil(practice_pass_fraction × n_practice_trials)` trials were answered
   correctly (default 0.75 × 16 = **12**); timed-out trials count as wrong. Below
   that, the operator sees the score, the participant hears “The practice block
   will be repeated,” and a freshly shuffled round runs. There is no cap on rounds
   (the operator can always end the session with Escape). Every practice row in
   the CSV and every practice attempt in the trace carries its `practice_round`.
3. **Main block.** The full shuffled constant-stimuli sequence (levels + catch
   trials, interleaved). **Feedback is off** here unless `feedback: true` is set.
   With the default `break_every_n_trials: 0` the block runs **continuously**:
   no break screens, nothing for the participant to talk about, matching the
   briefing. Set it to a positive number to pause on a break prompt every that
   many answered trials (resumed with **Space** / **Enter**).
4. **End screen.** A "Session complete" message confirms data was saved.

Within a single trial the participant slides a finger across the touch surface to
explore the two bars. The electroadhesion signal is delivered over the **bar
interior only** (interior = ON, exterior = OFF), so each bar is felt as a raised
region whose width is governed by the timing method above. When ready, the
participant responds with either keyboard layout:

- **Left arrow** (or **Numpad 4**, which carries the ◀ legend on a numpad) — the
  left bar felt taller.
- **Right arrow** (or **Numpad 6**, ▶) — the right bar felt taller.
- **Escape** (main keyboard, operator only) — safely exit the experiment. Numpad
  0 and Numpad Enter do nothing, so a stray press by the answering hand cannot
  end the session or advance a screen.

Every trial, **practice included**, runs under the same response limit
(`response_timeout_s`, 30 seconds by default), with a visible countdown that turns
red for the final five seconds — practice is where the participant should first
meet the clock, not the main block. Two short synthesized cues mark the two ways a
trial can end (`experiment/audio_cues.py`):

- **Answer registered** — a brief rising blip. Identical for correct and incorrect
  answers, so it never leaks feedback in the no-feedback main block; it only means
  "recorded, moving on".
- **Time expired** — a soft descending chime: slow attack, falling interval, long
  release. Deliberately an invitation back to the task rather than an alarm.

An unanswered trial is **not** dropped and **not** replaced on the spot. It is
deferred to a retry pool that is replayed, reshuffled, once the whole scheduled
sequence has been shown, so the session still collects the configured number of
responses. The handover into that retry round is silent — no announcement screen,
no break prompt — so from the participant's side a repeated trial is just the next
trial.

`max_trial_attempts` (default 3, first showing included) is what keeps the retry
loop finite: it caps how many times any one trial is presented, so total
presentations are bounded by `n_trials * max_trial_attempts` no matter how many go
unanswered. A trial that uses up its attempts is recorded as `exhausted` — logged
to the console and left in the trace database as a `timeout` attempt, costing one
observation at its level rather than stalling the run. The curve fit only ever
consumes `answered` rows, so none of this reaches the psychometric estimate.

Response time is logged per completed trial for reference. Which side holds the
reference vs. the comparison is counterbalanced within each level, and a response
is scored correct when it matches the objectively taller side.

### Blind test variant

Setting `blind_test_mode: true` hides the bars visually so they can be located
**by touch alone** — no on-screen rectangles, only the haptic signal and a touch
cursor. This enforces the study's premise of height discrimination *without*
visual information, and is the condition of interest for non-visual data access;
leave it `false` for sighted-guided piloting and rig checks.

Animate the finger path of every main-block trial and build the grid heat map
from the session's trace (see *Movement trace* below):

```
python -m analysis.trace_movement animate experiment/data/P01_<ts>_trace.sqlite3 --out out/P01/anim
python -m analysis.trace_movement heatmap experiment/data/P01_<ts>_trace.sqlite3 --out out/P01/heat
```

### Trial log (`<session_id>_trials.csv`)

Every trial the participant was actually shown gets a row — practice included,
unanswered included — told apart by the **`outcome`** column:

| `outcome` | meaning | in the trace DB |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `answered` | a response was given; the only rows the curve fit consumes | `answered` |
| `timeout` | the response window closed and the trial was deferred for another attempt | `timeout` |
| `exhausted` | the last attempt allowed by `max_trial_attempts` also expired | `timeout` |
| `aborted` | the exit key or a closed window ended the trial, and with it the session | `aborted` |

The vocabulary lines up with the trace database's per-attempt `outcome`, so the
CSV and the replay recordings describe the same set of events. The one refinement
is `exhausted`: whether a timeout was the *last* allowed attempt is a scheduling
fact rather than a property of the attempt itself, so the trace still stores it as
`timeout`.

On every non-`answered` row `response` and `correct` are left **blank** rather than
`0`: no judgment was made, and a `0` would read as a wrong answer. `response_time_s`
holds how long the trial was actually open, and `passes_json` still describes what
the finger was doing — so "was the participant exploring or idle?" stays answerable
from the CSV alone, without opening the trace database.

Practice rows carry `is_practice = 1`. `analysis/fit_psychometric.py` skips both
practice and non-`answered` rows, so the psychometric fit is unaffected by any of
this. CSVs written before the column existed load as `answered` (they only ever
contained answered trials).

### Movement trace

With `record_main_trace: true`, each constant-stimuli session also creates
`experiment/data/<session_id>_trace.sqlite3`. It records every attempt of
every **practice and main-block** trial, including attempts that end in timeout
or abort; practice attempts are tagged `is_practice = 1` with their
`practice_round`, main-block attempts have `is_practice = 0`. Staircase-pilot
sessions are not recorded. Cursor samples (screen px and surface mm, speed,
side, signal state, ~60 Hz) are accumulated in small in-memory batches and
SQLite writes run on a dedicated worker thread, so the real-time trial loop
never performs disk I/O. The trace is intended for the offline replay,
animation and heat-map tools; none of those run during an experiment.

#### Per-trial animation and grid heat map (`analysis/trace_movement.py`)

```
python -m analysis.trace_movement animate TRACE [--trial N] [--include-practice] [--speed 2] [--fps 30] [--format gif|mp4] --out DIR
python -m analysis.trace_movement heatmap TRACE [--cell-mm 2] [--margin-mm 15] [--metric visits|dwell_ms|samples] [--per-attempt] [--include-practice] --out DIR
```

`animate` writes one GIF (or MP4, if `ffmpeg` is on the PATH) per attempt: the
two bars to scale in surface millimetres (reference blue, comparison green,
taller side named in the title), the full path so far in grey, the last second
in red, and the fingertip as a marker that is green while the electroadhesion
signal is on. The HUD shows time, speed and the side being touched.

`heatmap` lays a grid of `--cell-mm` cells over the bars plus `--margin-mm`
around them, anchored on the bars' edges and the baseline so cell borders line
up with bar borders. Each cell counts **visits** (how many times the finger
entered the cell), **dwell_ms** (time spent in it) and raw **samples**. By
default the whole main block is aggregated into one map with the reference
height drawn solid and the tallest/shortest comparison dashed;
`--per-attempt` writes one map per attempt with that trial's actual bars. Every
map is saved as PNG and as a long-format CSV (`ix, iy, x0_mm .. y1_mm, visits,
dwell_ms, samples`) for re-plotting or cross-participant comparison.

Open the interactive replay browser with:

```bash
python -m experiment.replay
```

The left panel lists trace databases and their attempts in chronological order.
Select an attempt, then use **Play/Pause**, **Restart**, or the clickable timeline.
The left/right arrow keys seek by one second and Space toggles playback. A
deterministic `demo_replay_trace.sqlite3` recording is created automatically so
the browser can be evaluated before real participant traces are available. Pass
`--no-demo` to hide that recording.

### Supervisor launcher (GUI)

`experiment/gui.py` is a small Tkinter control panel for the supervisor, so
repeat sessions don't require re-typing config values or CLI flags by hand:

```
python -m experiment.gui
```

It opens pre-filled with the previously used configuration
(`experiment/configs/.last_used.yaml`, not versioned), so most sessions only
need the participant ID changed before pressing **Apply**. Apply writes the
form values out, hides the panel, and launches the participant-facing pygame
screen (`experiment.main`) as a subprocess; the panel reappears automatically
once that session ends.

The **Past Recordings** tab lists saved trace databases and their attempts in
chronological order. Selecting an attempt opens Play/Pause, Restart, and
timeline controls and renders the replay directly inside the launcher window;
it does not create a separate Pygame window. Replay modules are loaded only
when that tab is opened and playback is stopped before an experiment starts.
Answered attempts show the selected side (Left or Right), prefixed by a check
mark for a correct response or a cross for an incorrect response. With
Auto-next enabled, the player waits briefly at the end of an attempt and then
continues with the next attempt in chronological order.
