    ``±delta_max_pct``, which is only ever the single most extreme level; if

    to the surface all drift, so that imbalance lands directly on the
    threshold estimate. Blocking makes the split exactly even by
    construction, and caps same-level runs at two.

    Catch trials are spread one per block for the same reason: shuffled in
    globally, 28% of sessions put four or more of the six in the same third
    of the session and 23% left a third with none, which is a poor way to
